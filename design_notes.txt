Notes on assembly robots:

    - The assembly robots do not interact with DOR except for the workflow
      changes provided by robot framework. Instead, all of the work occurs
      directly in the file system (in the object's druid tree directory).

    - Typically, a robot does some work and then adds more information to the
      content_metadata.xml file sitting in the druid tree directory.


Robots:

    - Create JP2.

    - Compute checksums.

    - Compare checksums -- computed vs those from data provider.

    - Compute image attributes.

    - Initiate the common-accessioning workflow.
