== Dependencies

Check dependencies for jp2 creation in the assembly-image gem.


== Running tests

For local testing, add this to your bash profile:

    export ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT="local"


== Deployment

See the Capfile.


== General notes on the assembly robots

The assembly robots do not interact with DOR, except for the workflow changes
provided by robot framework. Instead, all of the work occurs directly in the
file system (in the object's druid tree directory).

Typically, a robot does some work and then adds more information to the
contentMetadata.xml file sitting in the druid tree directory.


== Robots

    - Create JP2.

    - Compute checksums.

    - Compare checksums -- computed vs those from data provider.

    - Compute image attributes.

    - Initiate the common-accessioning workflow.
